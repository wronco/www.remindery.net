If you've ever sold or bought something online, you know about abandoned shopping carts. Abandoned carts are shopping sessions that progress almost - but not *quite* all the way to a purchase. *Two-thirds* of shopping carts are abandoned, and basic steps toward rescuing those purchases are one of the great low-hanging fruits of online stores (and if you haven't started to pursue them for your online store, put it on your to-do list of "things that will make me 15% more money").

For retail ecommerce, targeting abandoned shopping carts is an easy way to make more sales. For SaaS, we should think of abandoned trials the same way. 

* They represent similar levels of customer interest and commitment
* Each is a place where a small improvement is worth a lot of money
* Both are high-ROI places to invest your energy

You probably already send a trial expiration email. Maybe you even ask for the sale ("click here to upgrade!"). But you're still probably not connecting with the majority of people whose trials expire. The good news is, you've still got a huge opportunity to reengage with those customers.

### Rule #1: Remember The Purpose Abandoned Cart Emails

We don't send abandoned cart emails to *convince* people to buy. They aren't a persuation tactic. They don't remind you of the many benefits of owning a holiday sweater - you've already been through all that.  No. The purpose of abandoned cart emails is to remind you that the product exists. That's all. It's beautifully simple, and it works because there are so many things competing for our attention online that we straight up forget we're buying something **while we're purchasing it**.

The never-ending distraction of the internet causes abandened shopping carts. People get part way through buying something, get caught up in something else, and then *forget all about the thing they were buying.* 

> The purpose of an abandoned cart email is to remind you about that thing you wanted.

And that's why they work! The merchant already knows the customer is interested by their actions (viz. "customer places item in shopping cart"), so - in a stastically significant percentage of cases - the cart must have been abandoned because the customer forgot. So when you abandon a shopping cart online, you'll usually get a reminder a day or two later. 

### Rule #2: Time It Right

Just like with abandoned cart emails, a post-trial expiration email needs to be sent at just the right time. So don't send them right after the trial ends. That would be like Amazon sending you an abandoned-cart email five minutes after you don't purchase that sweater. It's too soon! You might buy it, you might not buy it, but it's still in your mind. You're not sure if it will fit, you want to compare it with other sweaters, you want your brother's opinion. The thing you **don't** need is a reminder that it still exists.

The next day is a different story. You've gone about your life, you had an meeting about next quarter's budget, you switched the background picture on your phone, and - oh hey! - there's that sweater you were buying yesterday. Why didn't you buy it yesterday? Could be any number of reasons. But often, the reason is "I kind of forgot about it," and those customers often convert from an abandoned cart email.

**For SaaS**, the strategy is the same but the timing is slightly different. Because the trial period is multiple days long, it's prudent to wait roughly a week. Like with the retail example, the customer needs time to forget about you before you remind them.

### You lose a lot of business because people forget you exist.

Well timed communication can help fight that loss. Find the places where people are forgetting about you, and check in! You might be able to help them.
